                        <p> I am a senior at Vassar College, passionate about
                            pursuing my major in Computer Science. After
                            graduation, my goal is to work in the field of
                            Information Technology. I have gained a considerable
                            amount of experience in this field, having worked as
                            a Data Engineering Intern at Goldman Sachs during
                            the summer of 2021 and as a Software Development
                            Engineer Intern at Amazon Web Services under the
                            Marketing Org during the summer of 2022. Currently,
                            I am working as a teaching assistant for an
                            introductory computer science course at Vassar
                            College. Upon graduating, I will be joining Amazon
                            Web Services as a Software Development Engineer[L4].

                        <br>
                        <p> I enjoy solving technical problems, researching and
                            developing new technologies, and designing software
                            applications for different platforms. As a quick
                            learner, I excel in my ability to work under
                            pressure and handle demanding tasks. I have a fun,
                            outgoing personality, and I like meeting new people
                            and collaborating with them in a team environment.
                            In my spare time, I enjoy playing soccer, hiking,
                            watching anime, and taking long drives while
                            listening to music.
